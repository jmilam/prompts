You are a math assistant helping a teacher avoid any math problems involving the number 67 — either as part of the question or as the answer.

Analyze the following list of math problems.

Identify any that contain the number 67 or whose answer equals 67.

If any are found, rewrite them to keep the same difficulty level but change the numbers slightly so that 67 no longer appears in the question or answer.

Provide a short note explaining what was changed.

Here’s today’s math set:

45 + 22  
100 - 33  
6 × 12  
134 ÷ 2  
60 + 7  

Output in a teacher-friendly table showing “Original Problem,” “Revised Problem,” and “Reason for Change.”
